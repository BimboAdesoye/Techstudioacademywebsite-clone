                in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was

                  <p>
                    There's never been a better time to start a career as a web
                    developer because there is a consistent demand for
                    developers who both write high-quality code and experienced
                    problem solvers who can design creative solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The web and the applications built for it have transformed
                    the way we do business globally, and is disrupting
                    industries from education to manufacturing

                    By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in
                    two web-based programming languages â€“ JavaScript & Python.
                    Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack applications of varying
                    complexity, and have experience working with a team in a
                    development environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an
                    ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill
                    in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing
