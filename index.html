                  <p>
                    There's never been a better time to start a career as a web
                    developer because there is a consistent demand for
                    developers who both write high-quality code and experienced
                    problem solvers who can design creative solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The web and the applications built for it have transformed
                    the way we do business globally, and is disrupting
                    industries from education to manufacturing

                  <p>
                    By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in
                    two web-based programming languages – JavaScript & Python.
                    You’ll have built several full-stack applications of varying
                    complexity, and have experience working with a team in a
                    development environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an
                    ever-changing field. You’ll have gained foundational skill
                    in many disciplines that touch web development – managing
                    complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted
                    passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to
                    prepare them to scale.

                    Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum
                    of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The
                    course will walk you through installing the necessary free

                  <p>
                    At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics,
